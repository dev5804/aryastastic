            In order to maintain the overall integrity of the scientific investigation, it is crucial to appropriately address any statistical issues that may arise in any of these fields. Ignoring these worries could result in a total waste of time and money, which is unethical considering the possibility that study participants could suffer negative consequences without advancing scientific knowledge.
